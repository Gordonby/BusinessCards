# Business Cards

An awesome template for business cards. The `.ai` files are in Adobe Illustrator format.

I first came across this design fromn [Christina Compy](https://twitter.com/ccompy), but it seems the original template came from [Anthony Chu](https://twitter.com/nthonyChu), who in turn got it from [Alex Karcher](https://twitter.com/AlexKarcher). Kudos to all involved :)

The cool logo is from [Ashley McNamara](https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara). All her amazing artwork is available on her [GitHub page](https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/Developer-Advocate-Bit). Thank you for your great art, and sharing it with the world.
